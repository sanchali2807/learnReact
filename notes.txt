react is a  js library not a framework used to built or arrange  web application 
focus on making web application using components 
components is a self contained section of code as a building block
like a block building game
use virtual dom which is a lightweight version of real dom can keep track of the changes made to the virtual dom and then apply those changes to the real dom only that specific part 



  props read only properties that are shared between components a parent component can send data to a child component 
  for eg 
  we send key value pair to the component in the parent file such as name in the app.jsx and use it as an arguemnent for the chiold component which is students
  boolean do now directly display to the dom you need to use them woth ternary operator
  Prop types is a mechanism that th epassed value is of the correct datatype




  conditional rendering allows you to control what hets rendered in your ap;licationa t a certain conditions
  show hode or change components
