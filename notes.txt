react is a  js library not a framework used to built or arrange  web application 
focus on making web application using components 
components is a self contained section of code as a building block
like a block building game
use virtual dom which is a lightweight version of real dom can keep track of the changes made to the virtual dom and then apply those changes to the real dom only that specific part 



  props read only properties that are shared between components a parent component can send data to a child component 
  for eg 
  we send key value pair to the component in the parent file such as name in the app.jsx and use it as an arguemnent for the chiold component which is students
  boolean do now directly display to the dom you need to use them woth ternary operator
  Prop types is a mechanism that th epassed value is of the correct datatype




  conditional rendering allows you to control what hets rendered in your ap;licationa t a certain conditions
  show hode or change components
  






  click event 
  an. intersection when a user clicks on a specific element we can respond to clicks by passing a callback to the onClick event handler
  if we pass parameters in paranthesis then the function will be envoked right away even without that specific event occuring
    // so we need to wrap that function with either a new fucntion or by arrow function 





react hook
special function that allows functional components to use react features without writing class components 
if it starts woth use

useState()
a react hook that allows the creation of stateful variable and a setter function to update its value in the virtual dom
inorder to use a react hook we need to import it
useState return an array with two elements a variabke and a setter function
use array deconstructuring 
for useState you can pass an initial state






onchange()
is an event handler user primarily with form elements
triggers a function every time the value of an input changes



updater function in react
passed as an function to setState usually setYear(year+1)
if we add like this even if we want to use this line twice value will increase only once as the value of the year is not uodated
so we pass function 
like 
setyear(y => y + 1)
setyear(y => y + 1)
setyear(y => y + 1)

either prevYear or the very first letter y represents the prev cout not the present count
we are taking the  pending state to calculate the pending state
adding to a queue
within an arrow function if you have a set of curly braces js thinks you are writing a multiline statemnet
to create a js object surround curly with paranthesis within an arrow function
